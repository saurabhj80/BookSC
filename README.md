# BookSC

Every semester university students are met with the challenge to find expensive textbooks for cheap. Every student wants to buy and some students are looking to gain back their invested money by selling their books. There is a need to have a platform that is more focused and efficient than the currently used platforms to sell books and items between students within universities. Facebook is one such platform, but it does not prioritize the buying and selling and hence students find themselves scrolling through summer pictures and coachella memories to find a seller for a specific textbook. BookSC aims to facilitate the buying and selling of university textbooks by offering a social network platform that prioritizes consumer needs and organizes the data so that it is easy for students to get into contact with their prospective buyer or seller.
